Normalization in SQL is a process used to organize a relational database efficiently and reduce data redundancy. The goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies and ensure that data is stored in a way that supports data integrity.

First Normal Form (1NF):
Eliminate duplicate columns from the same table.
Create a separate table for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column or set of columns (primary key).


Second Normal Form (2NF):
Meet the requirements of 1NF.
Remove partial dependencies, meaning that non-prime attributes (attributes not part of the primary key) are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

Third Normal Form (3NF):
Meet the requirements of 2NF.
Remove transitive dependencies, meaning that non-prime attributes are not dependent on other non-prime attributes.

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
Definition:

A relation is in BCNF if it is in 3NF, and for every non-trivial functional dependency, the determinant is a superkey.
